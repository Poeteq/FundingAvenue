                                I was very nervous in the beginning but after speaking to the underwriting manager and being assigned
                                to the account manager, my nervousness washed away. Thank you for being patient with little ol’ me.
                                Their customer service is always prompt. Ms. Christie is always so nice and kind. I enjoy doing business
                                with them. I will return in the future when my business needs a second location.

                                What can I say? This group of hard workers has helped me greatly in my business! I was struggling with
                                my financial situation but they have helped me so much. The whole process is smoothly done. They
                                have informed with updates every step of the way. I tend to worry a lot but with them, I feel safe and I
                                put a lot of trust with them! They did not disappoint! Every question was never left unanswered.
                                Funding Avenue was the best decision I made! Thanks guys!

                                Never in a million years would I think that obtaining funding of my business will be this easy! I was in
                                need to renovate my business and that adds up to a lot of needed funds. I’ve been to many other banks,
                                brokers, agencies, you name it! But their rates were always so high and I don’t want to go in
                                over my head with something I will not be able to handle later. Funding Avenue have made this all
                                possible and I can not be even happier!! They are great! They are amazing! What can I say by saying
                                thank you and thank you. I will definitely recommend all my friends and family in need of business
                                funding! (They do personal funding as well!). Elsie is a wonderful account manager!
